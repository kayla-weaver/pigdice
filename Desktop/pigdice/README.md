# _Pig Dice!_

#### By _**Kayla Weaver and Jordan Kennedy**_

#### _{Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as they wish, adding all roll results to a running total, but losing their gained score for the turn if they roll a 1.}_

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* JavaScript
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## Description

_{Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

    If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
    If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
    If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

The first player to score 100 or more points wins. }_
